### Paper

This blog is a reading note for the paper "Overcoming catastrophic forgetting in neural networks", which is famous know as elastic weight consolidation (EWC).

### Background

In this paper, the authors designed an algorithm to mimic the continual learning by reducing the spasticity of synapses that are vital to perniciously learned tasks in brains. They tried to find the neighborhood of older tasks as a new task coming in and implemented constraints to determine the important parameters to perceive in the continual training process.

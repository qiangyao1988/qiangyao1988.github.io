<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently in the fifth year of my Ph.D. program in the Department of Computer Science at Wayne State University, 
where I work in the Trustworthy AI lab under the supervision of <a href="https://dongxiaozhu.github.io/" target="_blank"> Dr. Dongxiao Zhu</a>. 
My research mainly focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning Theory and Applications. 
My dedication to these areas has led to the publication of numerous research papers at top AI conferences, including NeurIPS, IJCAI, AAAI, ICML, MICCAI, and IJCNN, among others. 
I have a strong passion for research and a demonstrated ability to apply my knowledge to real-world challenges.

Michael E. Conrad Award (Highest Honor at WSU CS Department)

<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently in the fifth year of my Ph.D. program in the Department of Computer Science at Wayne State University, 
where I work in the Trustworthy AI lab under the supervision of <a href="https://dongxiaozhu.github.io/" target="_blank"> Dr. Dongxiao Zhu</a>. 
My research mainly focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP)&Large Language Models (LLMs), Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning Theory & Applications. 
My dedication to these areas has led to the publication of numerous research papers at top AI conferences, including NeurIPS, IJCAI, AAAI, ICML, MICCAI, and IJCNN, among others. 
I have a strong passion for research and a demonstrated ability to apply my knowledge to real-world challenges.

# üìù Selected Papers

## Jailbreak and Guard Aligned Language Models with Only Few In-Context Demonstrations (Preprint)
**Zeming Wei**, Yifei Wang, Yisen Wang${}^\dagger$
- Uncover the vulnerability and robustness of aligned language models under only few in-context demonstrations without fine-tuning
- Propose In-Context Attack (ICA) and In-Context Defense (ICD) to jailbreak and guard aligned language models
- Shed light on the potential of in-context learning (ICL) to manipulate the alignment of LLMs
- [[pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06387)] [[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06387)]

## CFA: Class-wise Calibrated Fair Adversarial Training (CVPR 2023)
**Zeming Wei**, Yifei Wang, Yiwen Guo, Yisen Wang${}^\dagger$
- Theoretically and empirically investigate the preference of different classes for adversarial configurations in Adversarial Training (AT)
- Propose a CFA framework that customizes specific training configurations for each class automatically
- CFA improves both overall robustness and fairness, and can be easily incorporated into other AT variants
- [[pdf](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Wei_CFA_Class-Wise_Calibrated_Fair_Adversarial_Training_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf)] [[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14460)] [[code](https://github.com/PKU-ML/CFA)]

## Sharpness-Aware Minimization Alone can Improve Adversarial Robustness (ICML 2023 Workshop)
**Zeming Wei\*${}^{\boldsymbol\dagger}$**, Jingyu Zhu\*, Yihao Zhang\*
- Theoretically show that using Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) can improve adversarial robustness
- Empirically illustrate that SAM can improve robustness with a friendly computational cost and no decrease in natural accuracy
- Propose that SAM can be regarded as a lightweight substitute for AT under certain requirements
- [[pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.05392)] [[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05392)] [[code](https://github.com/weizeming/SAM_AT)]

## Weighted Automata Extraction and Explanation of Recurrent Neural Networks for Natural Language Tasks (Journal of Logical and Algebraic Methods in Programming)
**Zeming Wei**, Xiyue Zhang, Yihao Zhang, Meng Sun${}^\dagger$
- Extending WFA extraction methods of RNNs from formal to natural language tasks by identifying transition sparsity and context dependency problems
- Propose an RNN interpretation framework with a transition-based word embedding of the extracted automata  
- Further propose two applications (pretraining and adversarial attack) on RNNs with the embedding

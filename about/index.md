Hi there,

This is my personal blogging space. 

I am Yao, a Ph.D student from Wayne State University, Detroit, USA. My major is computer science. My reserach focuses on machine learning and natural language processing. 

I come from Xi'an, a famous historical city in China. I have been married and my wife gave birth to a little baby girl last year. Our baby is so cute, we all love here very much. It is a lot of fun to see her growing up everyday.

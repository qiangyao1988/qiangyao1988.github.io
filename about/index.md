Hi there,

This is my personal blogging space. 


I am Yao, a Ph.D student in Wayne State University. My major is computer science. My reserach focuses on machine learning and natural language processing. 

I come from Xi'an, a famous historical city in China. I have married and my wife gave birth to a little baby girl last year. The baby is so cute, we all love here very much. It is a lot of fun to see her growing up.
